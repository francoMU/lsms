This readme serves as a guideline on how too finish the project.
The goal is a program the reads in a structure and some parameters in a toml format.
It will calculate the structure constants `B_ij`


1. Structure that contains all the parameters

    - Structure Class
    - Parameter Class
   


2. Structure that contains the Structure (Lattice, Atom positions, Atom types)

3. Solver for the structure constants Bij and D of course
