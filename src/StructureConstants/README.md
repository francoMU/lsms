This readme serves as a guideline on how too finish the project.
The goal is a program the reads in a structure and some parameters in a toml format.
It will calculate the structure constants `B_ij`


1. 
   - create a `Structure Class`
   - Add some algos from pymatgen to that class "calculate nearest distance for example"
   - One can copy that from GA
   - make it a round thing
   - Make also an adapter to spglib


   


2. Structure that contains the Structure (Lattice, Atom positions, Atom types)

3. Solver for the structure constants Bij and D of course
